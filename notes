deploy ML Pipline:

- Gathering Data Source;
- Feature Engineering;
- Feature Selection;
- ML model building;
- Continuos output;


Feature Engineering:
- Missing datas
- Distribution
	linear models assumption: Gaussian distribution;
	Other models: No assumption;

- Labels (categoricals)
- Outliers
- Features magnitude
	is this model sensitive to feature scale?

Feature Selection:
get best features to predict;

at a context of deployment, feature selection generate less:
- log files.
- code.

	variable redudance:
	constant variables, 
	duplications,
	correlation,
	quasi0 constant variables (99% show same value)

methods: Embedded, wrappers and filter methods.


#Filter Methods

atributs:
model agnostic (independ of ML alg)
based only in variable charateristic
pros:
quick feature remove
fast computation

contras:
does not capture redundancy
"     "    "     feature interaction
poor model perfomance


#wrappers methods (grid alghs)
atributes:
Consider ML alg
evaluate a subset of features

pros:
consider feature interaction
evaluate subset of features;

contras:
ogten impracticabel
computation expensive
not model agnostic


#Embedded:

atributes:
feature selection during trainig of ML alg

pros:
good model performance
capture feature interaction
faster than  wrapper

contras:
Not model agnostic
